-- | The product of two grammars.
--
-- In general, it is quite hard to define the product of two context-free
-- grammars in a way that keeps associativity and also "does what we want it to
-- do" (see paper). For linear grammars it is much easier. Also, for grammars
-- in certain normal forms, a simpler definition is possible. Due to this, we
-- make the choice of the actual way on how to multiply based on the type of
-- grammars given. This, however, should only affect the resulting rules, not
-- the (multi-tape) language that the operations yields.
--
-- TODO I think, left-linear could reasonably be expanded to both, left- and
-- right-linear and maybe linear in general.
--
-- NOTE A proof for associativity is possible, but generally hard, so we prefer
-- to let the framework perform the proof for us.
